# hello-world
GitHub hello world demonstration project

I am new to GitHub and learning how to use the system to manage projects.
I initially created this account to learn GitHub, but got distracted before getting too far, so I'm starting over now.
I'm interested in AI programming, and have a background in math, physics, and chemistry.
